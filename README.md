## 🛠️ Notes

- Run the scripts **in order** for consistent results.
- The output of each step is used as the input for the next stage.

## 🛠️ Setup
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt


## 🚀 Execution Order

Run the scripts in the following order to ensure the pipeline works correctly:

### 1. Merge Dataset
python notebook/merge-gw-season/merge_dataset.py


### 2. Combine Player Information
python notebook/merge-gw-season/combine_players_info.py

### 3. Predict xPoints
Run the following five scripts to predict xPoints based on player positions:
python notebook/predict-xpoints/predict_xpoints_general.py
python notebook/predict-xpoints/predict_xpoints_goalkeeper.py
python notebook/predict-xpoints/predict_xpoints_defender.py
python notebook/predict-xpoints/predict_xpoints_midfielder.py
python notebook/predict-xpoints/predict_xpoints_forward.py

### 4. Predict Starting Lineup
Finally, run the two scripts below to generate starting lineup predictions:
python notebook/starting-lineup/predict_lineup_general.py
python notebook/starting-lineup/predict_lineup_per_position.py
